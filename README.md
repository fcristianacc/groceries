# Online Supermarket App

This is an application in React which simulates an Online Supermarket.

This Online Supermarket presents a set of products of several categories and allows the buyer to:

1. login;
2. list all the products in alphabetical order;
3. list all the products by price;
4. list the products by category;
5. search for a product by its name;
6. add a product to the shopping cart;
7. remove a product from the shopping cart;
8. view the shopping cart content and the total price;
9. switch the idiom (PT or EN).

My main goal is to learn this framework and get skills in frontend development.

To run the application we need to have _node.js_ and _npm_ installed and run the command `npm start` inside the project directory.

Finally, we simply go to the http://localhost:3000/ to access the Online Supermarket and enjoy it!
